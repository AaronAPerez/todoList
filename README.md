<b>Project Name:</b>  Mini Challenge 7 Simple TodoList <br>
<br>
<b>Project Description Requirements:</b> <br>
* Creating a To-Do List <br>
* Adding items to the list <br>
* Completing an item on the list (crossing out) <br>
* This api does NOT need a api key <br>
* Delete an item <br>
* Edit an item <br>

Stylize your To-Do list. This means styling your application in a thoughtful and meaningful way that is not the way we did it in class.<br>

Find two bugs and fix them.<br>
1) Input was accepting null as a value. Null is no longer an acceptable value, Issue was solved by using a conditional (ternary) operator <br>
2) The 3 editing functions caused issues. I added startediting, stopediting, and editing.
